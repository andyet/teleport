# YAML Configuration

### Configuration File

Teleport uses the YAML file format for configuration. A sample configuration file is shown below. By default, it is stored in `/etc/teleport.yaml`

!!! note "IMPORTANT":
    When editing YAML configuration, please pay attention to how your editor
    handles white space. YAML requires consistent handling of tab characters.

```yaml
# By default, this file should be stored in /etc/teleport.yaml

# This section of the configuration file applies to all teleport
# services.
teleport:
    # nodename allows to assign an alternative name this node can be reached by.
    # by default it's equal to hostname
    nodename: graviton

    # Data directory where Teleport daemon keeps its data.
    # See "Filesystem Layout" section above for more details.
    data_dir: /var/lib/teleport

    # Invitation token used to join a cluster. it is not used on
    # subsequent starts
    auth_token: xxxx-token-xxxx

    # Optional CA pin of the auth server. This enables more secure way of adding new
    # nodes to a cluster. See "Adding Nodes" section above.
    ca_pin: "sha256:7e12c17c20d9cb504bbcb3f0236be3f446861f1396dcbb44425fe28ec1c108f1"

    # When running in multi-homed or NATed environments Teleport nodes need
    # to know which IP it will be reachable at by other nodes
    #
    # This value can be specified as FQDN e.g. host.example.com
    advertise_ip: 10.1.0.5

    # list of auth servers in a cluster. you will have more than one auth server
    # if you configure teleport auth to run in HA configuration.
    # If adding a node located behind NAT, use the Proxy URL. e.g.
    #  auth_servers:
    #     - teleport-proxy.example.com:3080
    auth_servers:
        - 10.1.0.5:3025
        - 10.1.0.6:3025

    # Teleport throttles all connections to avoid abuse. These settings allow
    # you to adjust the default limits
    connection_limits:
        max_connections: 1000
        max_users: 250

    # Logging configuration. Possible output values are 'stdout', 'stderr' and
    # 'syslog'. Possible severity values are INFO, WARN and ERROR (default).

#### Public Addr

Notice that all three Teleport services (proxy, auth, node) have an optional
`public_addr` property. The public address can take an IP or a DNS name.
It can also be a list of values:

```yaml
public_addr: ["proxy-one.example.com", "proxy-two.example.com"]
```

Specifying a public address for a Teleport service may be useful in the following use cases:

* You have multiple identical services, like proxies, behind a load balancer.
* You want Teleport to issue SSH certificate for the service with the
  additional principals, e.g. host names.

## Authentication

Teleport uses the concept of "authentication connectors" to authenticate users when
they execute `tsh login` command. There are three types of authentication connectors:

### Local Connector

Local authentication is used to authenticate against a local Teleport user database. This database
is managed by `tctl users` command. Teleport also supports second factor authentication
(2FA) for the local connector. There are three possible values (types) of 2FA:

  * `otp` is the default. It implements [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm)
     standard. You can use [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator) or
    [Authy](https://www.authy.com/) or any other TOTP client.
  * `u2f` implements [U2F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor) standard for utilizing hardware (USB)
    keys for second factor.
  * `off` turns off second factor authentication.

Here is an example of this setting in the `teleport.yaml`:

```yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: local
    second_factor: off
```

### Github OAuth 2.0 Connector

This connector implements Github OAuth 2.0 authentication flow. Please refer
to Github documentation on [Creating an OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/)
to learn how to create and register an OAuth app.

Here is an example of this setting in the `teleport.yaml`:

```yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: github
```

See [Github OAuth 2.0](#github-oauth-20) for details on how to configure it.

### SAML

This connector type implements SAML authentication. It can be configured
against any external identity manager like Okta or Auth0. This feature is
only available for Teleport Enterprise.

Here is an example of this setting in the `teleport.yaml`:

```yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: saml
```

### OIDC

Teleport implements OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication, which is similar to
SAML in principle. This feature is only available for Teleport Enterprise.

Here is an example of this setting in the `teleport.yaml`:

```yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: oidc
```


### FIDO U2F

Teleport supports [FIDO U2F](https://www.yubico.com/about/background/fido/)
hardware keys as a second authentication factor. By default U2F is disabled. To start using U2F:

* Enable U2F in Teleport configuration `/etc/teleport.yaml`.
* For CLI-based logins you have to install [u2f-host](https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-host/) utility.
* For web-based logins you have to use Google Chrome, as it is the only browser supporting U2F at this time.

```yaml
# snippet from /etc/teleport.yaml to show an example configuration of U2F:
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: local
    second_factor: u2f
    # this section is needed only if second_factor is set to 'u2f'
    u2f:
       # app_id must point to the URL of the Teleport Web UI (proxy) accessible
       # by the end users
       app_id: https://localhost:3080
       # facets must list all proxy servers if there are more than one deployed
       facets:
       - https://localhost:3080
```

For single-proxy setups, the `app_id` setting can be equal to the domain name of the
proxy, but this will prevent you from adding more proxies without changing the
`app_id`. For multi-proxy setups, the `app_id` should be an HTTPS URL pointing to
a JSON file that mirrors `facets` in the auth config.

!!! warning "Warning":
    The `app_id` must never change in the lifetime of the cluster. If the App ID
    changes, all existing U2F key registrations will become invalid and all users
    who use U2F as the second factor will need to re-register.
	When adding a new proxy server, make sure to add it to the list of "facets"
	in the configuration file, but also to the JSON file referenced by `app_id`


**Logging in with U2F**

For logging in via the CLI, you must first install [u2f-host](https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-host/).
Installing:

```yaml
# OSX:
$ brew install libu2f-host

# Ubuntu 16.04 LTS:
$ apt-get install u2f-host
```

Then invoke `tsh ssh` as usual to authenticate:

```
tsh --proxy <proxy-addr> ssh <hostname>
```

!!! tip "Version Warning":
    External user identities are only supported in [Teleport Enterprise](/enterprise/). Please reach
    out to `sales@gravitational.com` for more information.
